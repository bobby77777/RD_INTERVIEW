### Interview Assignments
Please read and complete the following requirements step by step. Try to complete the bonus section as
well to show your extra capabilities if possible.

### Requirements
1. Generate four binary files (A.bin, B.bin, C.bin, D.bin) with sizes of 7, 8, 9, and 10 MiB 
respectively. The content of these files must be randomized. You may use any Linux utility 
program or write your own script to accomplish this.
2. Develop a program in C/C++, named “backup”, to create a parity file (P.bin) from A.bin, B.bin,
C.bin, and D.bin. Please design the program arguments/options to take the input and output files.
3. Delete any one of the files generated in step 1.
4. Write a program in C/C++, named “restore”, to recover the deleted file using P.bin and the
remaining three files from step 1. Please design the program arguments/options to take the
input and output files.

### Bonus
1. Create a bash script to demonstrate the correct functionality of your programs.
2. Use a local Git repository or a private GitHub repository to manage your source code.
